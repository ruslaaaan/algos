Ways to resolve problems:
1. Way:
Start with muting/separating functionality
    (example:when sort happening, only stop button working, etc) 
Deal with Stop function
    When sort is happening, only stop button working -> when stop button clicked, state of array is updated
Understand how array state or passed array and stats states interact with Chart and animations
See how to simplify sort function so clearTimeout can work within a single scope

2. Way: 
Start with understanding how to interact with Chart component animations 
See if need to implement states and holders while sort is running/or stop btn clicked 



LOCAL
SortHappening state local
    mute all local buttons, accept STOP
    create sync sort stop buttons trhu useEffect
    mute list switch in side-menu
Create array, random array buttons must reset CompareIDX, Sorted states, SortHappening
SortStop state local
    SORT button change to continue


sync mode is On 
    global state is watching
sync algo start onClick -> start local function once
    if sync algo start clicked -> local function started
    sync 

REVISIT TASKS:
 - Line up existing funcitonality, 
    debug all state falws
    add appropriate mutes in CSS
 - Implement usereducer for array states
 only after:
 - Proceed to Stop functionality
    solution: elevate timeout in innerLoop so clearTimeout can remove it on demand


Drive all functionality from inputs to parents
